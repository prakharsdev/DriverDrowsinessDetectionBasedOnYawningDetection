# DriverDrowsinessDetectionBasedOnYawningDetection

The idea behind this project is because of the high workload driver has an inadequate sleep schedule. This is one of the factors
of road accidents.
To overcome this I came up with an idea to develop a car safety application to alert the driver if he/she yawns. I choose
yawing for monitoring drivers drowsiness because of the natural human tendency that the first sign of fatigue is a yawn.
The person yawns only when he/she is feeling tired or sleepy. To alert the driver I have used the beep sound which not
pleasant to hear for a long duration. Hence it will force the driver to wake up if he/she yawns.

Below is the youtube link to the demo video:
